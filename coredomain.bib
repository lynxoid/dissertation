abstract = {The mechanisms responsible for the establishment of physical domains in metazoan chromosomes are poorly understood. Here we find that physical domains in Drosophila chromosomes are demarcated at regions of active transcription and high gene density that are enriched for transcription factors and specific combinations of insulator proteins. Physical domains contain different types of chromatin defined by the presence of specific proteins and epigenetic marks, with active chromatin preferentially located at the borders and silenced chromatin in the interior. Domain boundaries participate in long-range interactions that may contribute to the clustering of regions of active or silenced chromatin in the nucleus. Analysis of transgenes suggests that chromatin is more accessible and permissive to transcription at the borders than inside domains, independent of the presence of active or silencing histone modifications. These results suggest that the higher-order physical organization of chromatin may impose an additional level of regulation over classical epigenetic marks.},

@article{Kolbl2012,
abstract = {A nonrandom radial nuclear organization of genes has been well documented. This study provides further evidence that radial positioning depends on features of corresponding ∼1 Mbp chromatin domains (CDs), which represent the basic units of higher-order chromatin organization. We performed a quantitative three-dimensional analysis of the radial nuclear organization of three genes located on chromosome 1 in a DG75 Burkitt lymphoma-derived cell line. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed similar transcription levels for the three selected genes, whereas the total expression strength (TES) calculated as the sum of transcription of all genes annotated within a surrounding window of about 1 Mbp DNA differed for each region. Radial nuclear position of the studied CDs correlated with TES, i.e., the domain with the highest TES occupied the most interior position. Positions of CDs with stable TES values were stably maintained even under experimental conditions, resulting in genome-wide changes of the expression levels of many other genes. Our results strongly support the hypothesis that knowledge of the local chromatin environment is essential to predict the radial nuclear position of a gene.},

@article{Lin2012,
abstract = {The genome is folded into domains located in compartments that are either transcriptionally inert or transcriptionally permissive. Here we used genome-wide strategies to characterize domains during B cell development. Structured interaction matrix analysis showed that occupancy by the architectural protein CTCF was associated mainly with intradomain interactions, whereas sites bound by the histone acetyltransferase p300 or the transcription factors E2A or PU.1 were associated with intra- and interdomain interactions that are developmentally regulated. We identified a spectrum of genes that switched nuclear location during early B cell development. In progenitor cells, the transcriptionally inactive locus encoding early B cell factor (Ebf1) was sequestered at the nuclear lamina, which thereby preserved their multipotency. After development into the pro-B cell stage, Ebf1 and other genes switched compartments to establish new intra- and interdomain interactions associated with a B lineage-specific transcription signature.},

Potential scenarios leading to the observation of Hi-C domains and their association with the epigenomic context of the chromosomal elements involved are discussed. We argue that even though the mechanisms and precise physical structure underlying chromosomal domain demarcation are yet to be fully resolved, the implications to genome regulation and genome evolution are profound. Specifically, we hypothesize that domains are facilitating genomic compartmentalization that support the implementation of complex, modular, and tissue specific transcriptional program in metazoa.},
