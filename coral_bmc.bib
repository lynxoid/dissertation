@article{Hibbs2005,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The most common method of identifying groups of functionally related genes in microarray data is to apply a clustering algorithm. However, it is impossible to determine which clustering algorithm is most appropriate to apply, and it is difficult to verify the results of any algorithm due to the lack of a gold-standard. Appropriate data visualization tools can aid this analysis process, but existing visualization methods do not specifically address this issue. RESULTS: We present several visualization techniques that incorporate meaningful statistics that are noise-robust for the purpose of analyzing the results of clustering algorithms on microarray data. This includes a rank-based visualization method that is more robust to noise, a difference display method to aid assessments of cluster quality and detection of outliers, and a projection of high dimensional data into a three dimensional space in order to examine relationships between clusters. Our methods are interactive and are dynamically linked together for comprehensive analysis. Further, our approach applies to both protein and gene expression microarrays, and our architecture is scalable for use on both desktop/laptop screens and large-scale display devices. This methodology is implemented in GeneVAnD (Genomic Visual ANalysis of Datasets) and is available at http://function.princeton.edu/GeneVAnD. CONCLUSION: Incorporating relevant statistical information into data visualizations is key for analysis of large biological datasets, particularly because of high levels of noise and the lack of a gold-standard for comparisons. We developed several new visualization techniques and demonstrated their effectiveness for evaluating cluster quality and relationships between clusters.},

Most algorithms proposed to uncover modules, however, pro- duce one clustering that only reveals a single view of how the cell is organized. We describe two new methods to nd en- sembles of provably near-optimal modularity partitions that lie within a heuristically constrained search space. We also show how to count the number of solutions in this space that exist within a bounded modularity range. We apply our al- gorithms to a protein interaction network for S. cerevisiae and show how ne-grained di erences between near-optimal partitions can be used to de ne robust communities. We also propose a technique to nd structurally diverse near- optimal solutions and show that these di erent partitions are enriched for di erent biological functions. Our results indicate that near-optimal solutions can represent alterna- tive and complementary views of the network's structure},

@article{Lewis2010,
abstract = {Background: If biology is modular then clusters, or communities, of proteins derived using only protein interaction network structure should define protein modules with similar biological roles. We investigate the link between biological modules and network communities in yeast and its relationship to the scale at which we probe the network. Results: Our results demonstrate that the functional homogeneity of communities depends on the scale selected, and that almost all proteins lie in a functionally homogeneous community at some scale. We judge functional homogeneity using a novel test and three independent characterizations of protein function, and find a high degree of overlap between these measures. We show that a high mean clustering coefficient of a community can be used to identify those that are functionally homogeneous. By tracing the community membership of a protein through multiple scales we demonstrate how our approach could be useful to biologists focusing on a particular protein. Conclusions: We show that there is no one scale of interest in the community structure of the yeast protein interaction network, but we can identify the range of resolution parameters that yield the most functionally coherent communities, and predict which communities are most likely to be functionally homogeneous.},

While most available clustering algorithms work well on biological networks of moderate size, such as the yeast protein physical interaction network, they either fail or are too slow in practice for larger networks, such as functional networks for higher eukaryotes. Since an increasing number of larger biological networks are being determined, the limitations of current clustering approaches curtail the types of biological network analyses that can be performed.},

@article{Tsafrir2005,
abstract = {SUMMARY: We introduce a novel unsupervised approach for the organization and visualization of multidimensional data. At the heart of the method is a presentation of the full pairwise distance matrix of the data points, viewed in pseudocolor. The ordering of points is iteratively permuted in search of a linear ordering, which can be used to study embedded shapes. Several examples indicate how the shapes of certain structures in the data (elongated, circular and compact) manifest themselves visually in our permuted distance matrix. It is important to identify the elongated objects since they are often associated with a set of hidden variables, underlying continuous variation in the data. The problem of determining an optimal linear ordering is shown to be NP-Complete, and therefore an iterative search algorithm with O(n3) step-complexity is suggested. By using sorting points into neighborhoods, i.e. SPIN to analyze colon cancer expression data we were able to address the serious problem of sample heterogeneity, which hinders identification of metastasis related genes in our data. Our methodology brings to light the continuous variation of heterogeneity--starting with homogeneous tumor samples and gradually increasing the amount of another tissue. Ordering the samples according to their degree of contamination by unrelated tissue allows the separation of genes associated with irrelevant contamination from those related to cancer progression.

abstract = {Detecting community structure is fundamental to clarify the link between structure and function in complex networks and is used for practical applications in many disciplines. A successful method relies on the optimization of a quantity called modularity Newman and Girvan, Phys. Rev. E 69, 026113 (2004), which is a quality index of a partition of a network into communities. We find that modularity optimization may fail to identify modules smaller than a scale which depends on the total number L of links of the network and on the degree of interconnectedness of the modules, even in cases where modules are unambiguously defined. The probability that a module conceals well-defined substructures is the highest if the number of links internal to the module is of the order of sqrt2L or smaller. We discuss the practical consequences of this result by analyzing partitions obtained through modularity optimization in artificial and real networks.},

Parallel Sets are a new method for the visualization and interactive exploration of categorical data that shows data frequencies instead of the individual data points. The method is based on the axis layout of parallel coordinates, with boxes representing the categories and parallelograms between the axes showing the relations between categories. In addition to the visual representation, we designed a rich set of interactions. Parallel Sets allow the user to interactively remap the data to new categorizations and, thus, to consider more data dimensions during exploration and analysis than usually possible. At the same time, a metalevel, semantic representation of the data is built. Common procedures, like building the cross product of two or more dimensions, can be performed automatically, thus complementing the interactive visualization. We demonstrate Parallel Sets by analyzing a large CRM data set, as well as investigating housing data from two US states.},

abstract = {In many applications, one is interested in determining which of the properties of a network module change across conditions. For example, to validate the existence of a module, it is desirable to show that it is reproducible (or preserved) in an independent test network. Here we study several types of network preservation statistics that do not require a module assignment in the test network. We distinguish network preservation statistics by the type of the underlying network. Some preservation statistics are defined for a general network (defined by an adjacency matrix) while others are only defined for a correlation network (constructed on the basis of pairwise correlations between numeric variables). Our applications show that the correlation structure facilitates the definition of particularly powerful module preservation statistics. We illustrate that evaluating module preservation is in general different from evaluating cluster preservation. We find that it is advantageous to aggregate multiple preservation statistics into summary preservation statistics. We illustrate the use of these methods in six gene co-expression network applications including 1) preservation of cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in mouse tissues, 2) comparison of human and chimpanzee brain networks, 3) preservation of selected KEGG pathways between human and chimpanzee brain networks, 4) sex differences in human cortical networks, 5) sex differences in mouse liver networks. While we find no evidence for sex specific modules in human cortical networks, we find that several human cortical modules are less preserved in chimpanzees. In particular, apoptosis genes are differentially co-expressed between humans and chimpanzees. Our simulation studies and applications show that module preservation statistics are useful for studying differences between the modular structure of networks. Data, R software and accompanying tutorials can be downloaded from the following webpage: http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/ModulePreservation.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Consensus clustering, also known as cluster ensemble, is one of the important techniques for microarray data analysis, and is particularly useful for class discovery from microarray data. Compared with traditional clustering algorithms, consensus clustering approaches have the ability to integrate multiple partitions from different cluster solutions to improve the robustness, stability, scalability and parallelization of the clustering algorithms. By consensus clustering, one can discover the underlying classes of the samples in gene expression data. RESULTS: In addition to exploring a graph-based consensus clustering (GCC) algorithm to estimate the underlying classes of the samples in microarray data, we also design a new validation index to determine the number of classes in microarray data. To our knowledge, this is the first time in which GCC is applied to class discovery for microarray data. Given a pre specified maximum number of classes (denoted as K(max) in this article), our algorithm can discover the true number of classes for the samples in microarray data according to a new cluster validation index called the Modified Rand Index. Experiments on gene expression data indicate that our new algorithm can (i) outperform most of the existing algorithms, (ii) identify the number of classes correctly in real cancer datasets, and (iii) discover the classes of samples with biological meaning.

We develop a metric space of partitions from all existing cluster analysis methods applied to a given dataset (along with millions of other solutions we add based on combinations of existing clusterings) and enable a user to explore and interact with it and quickly reveal or prompt useful or insightful conceptualizations.

Many real-world networks are sparse and hierarchical, with m,n and d,log n, in which case our algorithm runs in essentially linear time, O(n log\^{}2n). As an example of the application of this algorithm we use it to analyze a network of items for sale on the web site of a large on-line retailer, items in the network being linked if they are frequently purchased by the same buyer. The network has more than 400 000 vertices and 2x10\^{}6 edges.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Microarray technology has been widely applied in biological and clinical studies for simultaneous monitoring of gene expression in thousands of genes. Gene clustering analysis is found useful for discovering groups of correlated genes potentially co-regulated or associated to the disease or conditions under investigation. Many clustering methods including hierarchical clustering, K-means, PAM, SOM, mixture model-based clustering and tight clustering have been widely used in the literature. Yet no comprehensive comparative study has been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods. RESULTS: In this paper, six gene clustering methods are evaluated by simulated data from a hierarchical log-normal model with various degrees of perturbation as well as four real datasets. A weighted Rand index is proposed for measuring similarity of two clustering results with possible scattered genes (i.e. a set of noise genes not being clustered). Performance of the methods in the real data is assessed by a predictive accuracy analysis through verified gene annotations. Our results show that tight clustering and model-based clustering consistently outperform other clustering methods both in simulated and real data while hierarchical clustering and SOM perform among the worst. Our analysis provides deep insight to the complicated gene clustering problem of expression profile and serves as a practical guideline for routine microarray cluster analysis.},

We present the Dynamic Tree Cut R package that implements novel dynamic branch cutting methods for detecting clusters in a dendrogram depending on their shape. Compared to the constant height cutoff method, our techniques offer the following advantages: (1) they are capable of identifying nested clusters; (2) they are flexible-cluster shape parameters can be tuned to suit the application at hand; (3) they are suitable for automation; and (4) they can optionally combine the advantages of hierarchical clustering and partitioning around medoids, giving better detection of outliers. We illustrate the use of these methods by applying them to protein-protein interaction network data and to a simulated gene expression data set.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Characterizing the structural properties of protein interaction networks will help illuminate the organizational and functional relationships among elements in biological systems. RESULTS: In this paper, we present a systematic exploration of the core/periphery structures in protein interaction networks (PINs). First, the concepts of cores and peripheries in PINs are defined. Then, computational methods are proposed to identify two types of cores, k-plex cores and star cores, from PINs. Application of these methods to a yeast protein interaction network has identified 110 k-plex cores and 109 star cores. We find that the k-plex cores consist of either "party" proteins, "date" proteins, or both. We also reveal that there are two classes of 1-peripheral proteins: "party" peripheries, which are more likely to be part of protein complex, and "connector" peripheries, which are more likely connected to different proteins or protein complexes. Our results also show that, besides connectivity, other variations in structural properties are related to the variation in biological properties. Furthermore, the negative correlation between evolutionary rate and connectivity are shown toysis. Moreover, the core/periphery structures help to reveal the existence of multiple levels of protein expression dynamics. CONCLUSION: Our results show that both the structure and connectivity can be used to characterize topological properties in protein interaction networks, illuminating the functional organization of cellular systems.},

However, CMV are still rarely implemented in commercial systems and many users are even not aware that multiple views are useful and coordination can help them to solve their problems. Even toolkits especially designed for information visualization often do not offer any coordination mechanisms for multiple views. One of possible reasons for this may be that existing CMV tools and approaches are insufficiently suited to real-life problems. Most of the CMV tools deal with single-table data sets of rather small sizes. A typical implementation allows one to create several displays (statistical graphics and/or geographical maps) representing individual entities and/or aggregates (e.g., histograms) and link them by brushing and selection. The displays are coordinated through exchanging references to selected entities. To our best knowledge, this approach works efficiently for tables with sizes up to about 105 records. Linking displays that reflect larger tables causes significant delays.},

We call the new methodology consensus clustering , and in conjunction with resampling techniques, it provides for a method to represent the consensus across multiple runs of a clustering algorithm and to assess the stability of the discovered clusters. The method can also be used to represent the consensus over multiple runs of a clustering algorithm with random restart (such as K-means, model-based Bayesian clustering, SOM, etc.), so as to account for its sensitivity to the initial conditions. Finally, it provides for a visualization tool to inspect cluster number, membership, and boundaries. We present the results of our experiments on both simulated data and real gene expression data aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the methodology in discovering biologically meaningful clusters.},

abstract = {A system of cluster analysis for genome-wide expression data from DNA microarray hybridization is described that uses standard statistical algorithms to arrange genes according to similarity in pattern of gene expression. The output is displayed graphically, conveying the clustering and the underlying expression data simultaneously in a form intuitive for biologists. We have found in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that clustering gene expression data groups together efficiently genes of known similar function, and we find a similar tendency in human data. Thus patterns seen in genome-wide expression experiments can be interpreted as indications of the status of cellular processes. Also, coexpression of genes of known function with poorly characterized or novel genes may provide a simple means of gaining leads to the functions of many genes for which information is not available currently.},

@article{Sharan2000,
abstract = {Novel DNA microarray technologies enable the monitoring of expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously. This allows a global view on the transcription levels of many (or all) genes when the cell undergoes specific conditions or processes. Analyzing gene expression data requires the clustering of genes into groups with similar expression patterns. We have developed a novel clustering algorithm, called CLICK, which is applicable to gene expression analysis as well as to other biological applications. No prior assumptions are made on the structure or the number of the clusters. The algorithm utilizes graph-theoretic and statistical techniques to identify tight groups of highly similar elements (kernels), which are likely to belong to the same true cluster. Several heuristic procedures are then used to expand the kernels into the full clustering. CLICK has been implemented and tested on a variety of biological datasets, ranging from gene expression, cDNA oligo-fingerprinting to protein sequence similarity. In all those applications it outperformed extant algorithms according to several common figures of merit. CLICK is also very fast, allowing clustering of thousands of elements in minutes, and over 100,000 elements in a couple of hours on a regular workstation.},

@article{Adamcsek2006,
abstract = {Most cellular tasks are performed not by individual proteins, but by groups of functionally associated proteins, often referred to as modules. In a protein association network modules appear as groups of densely interconnected nodes, also called communities or clusters. These modules often overlap with each other and form a network of their own, in which nodes (links) represent the modules (overlaps). We introduce CFinder, a fast program locating and visualizing overlapping, densely interconnected groups of nodes in undirected graphs, and allowing the user to easily navigate between the original graph and the web of these groups. We show that in gene (protein) association networks CFinder can be used to predict the function(s) of a single protein and to discover novel modules. CFinder is also very efficient for locating the cliques of large sparse graphs. Availability: CFinder (for Windows, Linux and Macintosh) and its manual can be downloaded from http://angel.elte.hu/clustering. Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available on Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {There is a wide set of evaluation metrics available to compare the quality of text clustering algorithms. In this article, we define a few intuitive formal constraints on such metrics which shed light on which aspects of the quality of a clustering are captured by different metric families. These formal constraints are validated in an experiment involving human assessments, and compared with other constraints proposed in the literature. Our analysis of a wide range of metrics shows that only BCubed satisfies all formal constraints. We also extend the analysis to the problem of overlapping clustering, where items can simultaneously belong to more than one cluster. As Bcubed cannot be directly applied to this task, we propose a modified version of Bcubed that avoids the problems found with other metrics.},
