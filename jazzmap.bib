We also explore the impact of edge crossings, a widely accepted readability aesthetic. Subjective data were gathered based on the methodology of Purchase et al.[14] Objective data were collected through an online system.   We found that both edge crossings and conventions pose significant affects on user preference and task performance of finding groups, but either has little impact on the perception of actor status. On the other hand, the node positioning and angular resolution might be more important in perceiving actor status. In visualizing social networks, it is important to note that the techniques that are highly preferred by users do not necessarily lead to best task performance.},

In doing so, we bring together literatures that are not normally in dialogue—one addressing generalism and the careers of creative personnel and the other addressing the circulation of capitals (e.g., cultural capital) in fields of cultural production. We find, among other things, that aesthetic generalism (being conversant in a wide range of genres) has a positive impact on both earnings and national recognition—with veteran musicians particularly benefitting from the relationship between aesthetic generalism and critical success. Those musicians with much social capital (e.g., number of local musicians known by name) and much human capital (years of musical experience) enjoy heightened economic, but not critical, success. Technical generalism (playing a wide range of musical instruments) has no bearing on economic success but has a negative impact on critical success—particularly for veteran jazz musicians. We discuss how such findings demonstrate the analytical utility of heeding the resources and “signaled competencies” that creative personnel have for negotiating fields of cultural production.},

In this article we take an orthogonal approach by introducing a novel point of view to the problem of overlapping communities. Instead of quantifying the quality of a set of communities, we choose to focus on the intrinsic community-ness of one given set of nodes. To do so, we propose a general metric on graphs, the cohesion, based on counting triangles and inspired by well established sociological considerations. The model has been validated through a large-scale online experiment called Fellows in which users were able to compute their social groups on Face- book and rate the quality of the obtained groups. By observing those ratings in relation to the cohesion we assess that the cohesion is a strong indicator of users subjective perception of the community-ness of a set of people.},

abstract = {Both homophily and tie formation remain well studied problems in the social sciences literature since several decades. Prior empirical work on networks seems to indicate that in several situations, high degree of homophily was observed to be behind an individual's desire to establish new ties. However in the context of today's social media, not all individuals are the same, topologically. That is, we observe a variety of ego network structures based on individuals' inlink-outlink relationships. In the context of tie formation in these networks, do different ego network topologies exhibit homophily along different attributes? How can we quantify and investigate these differences? To this end, we propose a variety of attributes along which homophily can be measured between individuals: including demographic attributes, activity-specific attributes and content-based attributes. We further categorize ego network structures as generators, mediators and receptors based on a measure called ego ratio. In our experiments on a large Twitter dataset comprising about 29.5M tweets, we observe, somewhat surprisingly, that for a few attributes, there was consistently high homophily (topical interest)/low homophily (gender, ethnicity) regardless of the ego network structure. Otherwise, mediators were observed to associate tie formation extensively with location, interactive ness and sentiment homophily, whereas generators were driven largely by information broadcasting behavior homophily. Implications of the findings in understanding the diverse range of motivations behind user participation in social media sites are discussed.},

So far, many tools have been provided that allow for the analysis of static networks and some for the temporal analysis of networks - however only on the vertex and edge level. In this paper we propose two approaches to analyze the evolution of two different types of online communities on the level of subgroups: The first method consists of statistical analyses and visualizations that allow for an interactive analysis of subgroup evolutions in communities that exhibit a rather membership structure. The second method is designed for the detection of communities in an environment with highly fluctuating members. For both methods, we discuss results of experiments with real data from an online student community.},

abstract = {Network evolution is a ubiquitous phenomenon in a wide variety of complex systems. There is an increasing interest in statistically modeling the evolution of complex networks such as small-world networks and scale-free networks. In this article, we address a practical issue concerning the visualization of network evolution. We compare the visualizations of co-citation networks of scientific publications derived by two widely known link reduction algorithms, namely minimum spanning trees (MSTs) and Pathfinder networks (PFNETs). Our primarily goal is to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the two methods in fulfilling the need for visualizing evolving networks. Two criteria are derived for assessing visualizations of evolving networks in terms of topological properties and dynamical properties. We examine the animated visualization models of the evolution of botulinum toxin research in terms of its co-citation structure across a 58-year span (1945-2002). The results suggest that although high-degree nodes dominate the structure of MST models, such structures can be inadequate in depicting the essence of how the network evolves because MST removes potentially significant links from high-order shortest paths. In contrast, PFNET models clearly demonstrate their superiority in maintaining the cohesiveness of some of the most pivotal paths, which in turn make the growth animation more predictable and interpretable. We suggest that the design of visualization and modeling tools for network evolution should take the cohesiveness of critical paths into account.},

abstract = {Increased interest in longitudinal social networks and the recognition that visualization fosters theoretical insight create a need for dynamic network visualizations, or network “movies.” This article confronts theoretical questions surrounding the temporal representations of social networks and technical questions about how best to link network change to changes in the graphical representation. The authors divide network movies into (1) static flip books, where node position remains constant but edges cumulate over time, and (2) dynamic movies, where nodes move as a function of changes in relations. Flip books are particularly useful in contexts where relations are sparse. For more connected networks, movies are often more appropriate. Three empirical examples demonstrate the advantages of different movie styles. A new software program for creating network movies is discussed in the appendix.},
